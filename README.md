   Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for denoising images
	The goal is to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for denoising images, specifically reconstructing high-quality, denoised images from a CIFAR-10 dataset. The chosen CIFAR-10 dataset provides a diverse range of small, colorful images for effective GAN training. The GAN architecture comprises a generator and discriminator. The generator takes noisy images, altered with a radial mask, as input and produces denoised images. The discriminator distinguishes between generated denoised images and real, clean images. Appropriate loss functions are defined for both the generator and discriminator, incorporating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for image reconstruction and adversarial loss for GAN training. The training procedure involves training the GAN using the noisy images with the radial mask and monitoring convergence while adjusting hyperparameters as needed. Evaluation entails assessing GAN performance on a separate validation set, comparing the denoised images generated by the model with the ground truth clean images to ensure effective denoising capabilities.
